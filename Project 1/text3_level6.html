            that I know.  I knew it before I came here this evening.  She has
            laid it carefully on one side for you.  I saw her do it.  It depends
            on yourself to stretch out your hand, and take it up:  but whether
            you will do so, is the problem I study.  Kneel again on the rug."

            "The flame flickers in the <span class="emphasis">eye</span>; the eye shines like dew; it looks
soft and full of feeling; it smiles at my jargon:  it is
susceptible; impression follows impression through its clear sphere;
where it ceases to smile, it is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs
on the lid:  that signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness.
It turns from me; it will not suffer further scrutiny; it seems to
deny, by a mocking glance, the truth of the discoveries I have
already made,--to disown the charge both of sensibility and chagrin:
its pride and reserve only confirm me in my opinion.  The eye is
favourable. As to the <span class="emphasis">mouth</span>, it delights at times in laughter; it is disposed
to impart all that the brain conceives; though I daresay it would be
silent on much the heart experiences.  Mobile and flexible, it was
never intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude:
it is a mouth which should speak much and smile often, and have
human affection for its interlocutor.  That feature too is
propitious. I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the <span class="emphasis">brow</span>; and that brow
professes to say,â€”

furiously, like true heathens, as they are; and the desires may
imagine all sorts of vain things:  but judgment shall still have the
last word in every argument, and the casting vote in every decision.
Strong wind, earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by:  but I shall
follow the guiding of that still small voice which interprets the
dictates of conscience."

            "Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected.  I have
formed my plans--right plans I deem them--and in them I have
attended to the claims of conscience, the counsels of reason.  I
know how soon youth would fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of
bliss offered, but one dreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were
detected; and I do not want sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution--such is
not my taste.  I wish to foster, not to blight--to earn gratitude,
not to wring tears of blood--no, nor of brine:  my harvest must be
in smiles, in endearments, in sweet-- That will do.  I think I rave
in a kind of exquisite delirium.  I should wish now to protract this
moment ad infinitum; but I dare not.  So far I have governed myself
thoroughly.  I have acted as I inwardly swore I would act; but
further might try me beyond my strength.

            Where was I?  Did I wake or sleep?  Had I been dreaming?  Did I
dream still?  The old woman's voice had changed:  her accent, her
gesture, and all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass--as
the speech of my own tongue.  I got up, but did not go.  I looked; I
stirred the fire, and I looked again:  but she drew her bonnet and
her bandage closer about her face, and again beckoned me to depart.
